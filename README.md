#  EV Market Size Analysis

This project analyzes the **Electric Vehicle (EV) market size** using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques. The goal is to uncover adoption trends, geographical distribution, popular EV types and models, and to estimate the growth of the EV market.

##  Project Overview
The EV industry is growing rapidly with increasing adoption worldwide. This analysis focuses on:
- EV adoption trends over time  
- Geographical distribution of EV registrations  
- Breakdown of EV types (BEV, PHEV, etc.)  
- Popular makes and models  
- Electric range progression over the years  
- Estimated market size growth  

The notebook provides insights into how EV technology and adoption are evolving, supporting data-driven decision-making for stakeholders in the automotive and energy sectors.
